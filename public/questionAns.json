        "answer": "Whenever we need to make use of side effects in our application, useEffect is the way to go. This hook doesn't present many complications, except for non-primitive data types, due to how JavaScript handles them. **Running once on mount: fetch API data. **Running on state change: validating input field. **Running on state change: live filtering.**Running on state change: trigger animation on new array value. **Running on props change: update paragraph list on fetched API data update. **Running on props change: updating fetched API data to get BTC updated price"
